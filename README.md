# Stochastic_BB
Python implementation of SVRG-BB and SGD-BB algorithms of the following paper:

["Barzilai-Borwein Step Size for Stochastic Gradient Descent". Conghui Tan, Shiqian Ma, Yu-Hong Dai, Yuqiu Qian. _NIPS 2016_.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6286-barzilai-borwein-step-size-for-stochastic-gradient-descent)


## Files

- stochastic_bb.py: the source code for SVRG-BB and SGD-BB algorithms
- example.py: an example showing how to use these two algorithms


## Requirements

The code can be run with either Python 2 or Python 3, with [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) package installed.

But to run the example, [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) are also needed.
